# React + Vite

# Movie Database Application

## Project Overview
The **Movie Database Application** is a frontend web application designed to provide users with a platform to search for movies and view detailed information about them. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, the application integrates a public movie API to fetch and display movie data dynamically. The project emphasizes responsive design, API integration, state management, and deployment, simulating a real-world development environment.

## Features
### 1. Fetch Movie Data
- Use a public movie API (e.g., OMDB API) to retrieve movie data based on user search queries.
- Display a list of movies matching the search criteria, including:
  - **Poster**: Thumbnail image.
  - **Title**: Movie name.
  - **Release Date**: Year of release.

### 2. Movie Details View
- Clicking a movie from the list provides detailed information, such as:
  - **Plot Summary**: Brief description of the storyline.
  - **Cast**: Key actors and their roles.
  - **Ratings**: Scores from sources like IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes.
  - **Genre**: Movie categories (e.g., Action, Drama).

### 3. Search Functionality
- Implement a search bar to allow users to input a movie name and get relevant results.
- Handle cases where no results are found with a user-friendly message.

### 4. Responsive UI Design
- Utilize **Tailwind CSS** to create a layout adaptable to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Ensure smooth navigation for movie lists and details on all devices.

### 5. Error Handling
- Manage network issues, invalid API responses, or no results with clear and informative error messages.

  - User interactions.
  - UI updates.
- Optionally explore tools like **Zustand** or **Redux** for advanced state management.

### 5. Deployment
- Deploy the application on platforms like **Netlify** or **Vercel**.
- Ensure optimal performance and accessibility in the production environment.

### Pagination for Search Results
- Implement pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.
